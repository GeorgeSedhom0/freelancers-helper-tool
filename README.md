# for now this is not really anything but the plan is

Making website to help freelancers create quality offers in no time
my main ideas for now is

- templetes for free use
- creating custom template
  You should be able to get the offer to send he customer in a few clicks by adding the link of the request he made or his name
  then selecting a few options to customize the offer then just paste it on the freelancing site
  i'll try to make it free but i might add some premuiem or something only if it scales so much that firebase free hosting isn't doing the trick
  and if somehow became rich i'll keep it free
  though you can always download the code and run locally and then you won't have to pay anything
- i think i'll put ads from adsense if it scales :)
